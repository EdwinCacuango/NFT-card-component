## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and Grid
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

How to use two img elementes inside a same div, center them and use :hover to make styles. 


```scss
.image-card {
  display: grid;
  max-width: 17.5rem;
  background-color: transparent;
  border-radius: 0.75rem;
  overflow: hidden;

  .art,
  .layer {
    grid-row: 1;
    grid-column: 1;
  }
  .art {
    position: relative;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    border-radius: 0.75rem;
    max-width: 100%;
  }
  .layer {
    opacity: 0;
    z-index: 1;
    align-self: center;
    justify-self: center;
  }

  &:hover {
    cursor: pointer;
    background-color: $cyan;
    .art {
      mix-blend-mode: multiply;
    }
    .layer {
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }
}

```

### Continued development
I really want to master the hover efect on the image, to create transitions with two o more elements (one above the other). That was to hard for me this time. 

### Useful resources

- [¿Cómo colocar dos elementos uno encima del otro, sin especificar una altura?](https://qastack.mx/programming/6780614/css-how-to-position-two-elements-on-top-of-each-other-without-specifying-a-hei) - This helped me to center tow elements on the image-card dive. I have some questions if that's the correct and optimized way.
